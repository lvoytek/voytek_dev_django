						Hi, my name is Lena Voytek. I am a programmer who specializes in operating systems, embedded software, and full-stack development. From drones controlled over cellular networks, to websites built from the ground up, I love building technology for the interconnected world.
						I currently work as a developer for Canonical on <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/server">Ubuntu Server</a>. I am a member of both <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a> and the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>.
						While you're here, feel free to take a look at some of my open source projects on the <a href="/projects">Projects page</a>. You can also find my official Resume on the <a href="/pages/resume">Resume page</a>. If you want a more visual representation of my skills,
						you can scroll further down this page. Thanks!
